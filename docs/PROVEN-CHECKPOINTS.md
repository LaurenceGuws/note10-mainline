# Proven checkpoint workflow

Note10 mainline bring-up advances as a ladder of physically proven BOOT
artifacts rather than returning to Android after every successful tranche.

## Authorities

### Proven MAINLINE checkpoint

The newest exact BOOT that has passed:

1. frozen artifact identity;
2. independent final review;
3. attended physical terminal-marker proof;
4. bounded stability observation;
5. durable proof recording.

This is the normal progression parent and routine rollback target for the next
mainline tranche.

Current promoted MAINLINE checkpoint:

`8dd7d4d2a160b1072f76c2d84ee30dce1bbaa8523fa53a4ecb72f9143f07d591`

It physically proves the first ordinary `start_kernel` initialization cluster
through `boot_cpu_init()` using the stable pure-green marker and remains
installed.

Previous proven MAINLINE checkpoint:

`3992fcbfd834db4e63da7a6350f4a7d99a4002528e636ccc053faf3a63051c0e`

### Android RECOVERY checkpoint

Immutable Android-inclusive recovery floor:

`1a78e5117cf23b3cab5547da2369018066c9ddac27307e97fce46026647ae2f9`

Use recovery only when Android/device-side archaeology is required or when the
mainline recovery chain itself is uncertain. It is not the routine rollback
target after a failed mainline experiment.

## Iteration

```text
latest proven MAINLINE checkpoint
    -> plan one bounded tranche
    -> independent plan review
    -> build/freeze exact candidate
    -> independent frozen-candidate review
    -> install candidate
    -> attended physical proof

PASS:
    promote exact candidate to proven MAINLINE checkpoint
    keep it installed
    continue from it

FAIL:
    restore previous proven MAINLINE checkpoint
    investigate only the newly crossed tranche

RECOVERY NEED:
    restore immutable Android RECOVERY checkpoint
```

## Packaging template versus progression parent

The current BOOT construction helper uses `magiskboot unpack/repack`. When a
promoted mainline BOOT already contains uniLoader plus zero padding,
`magiskboot unpack` trims that representation and does not expose the full
Android BOOT header `kernel_size` as the extracted `kernel` file size.

Therefore:

- the proven MAINLINE checkpoint remains the progression/rollback authority;
- the immutable Android RECOVERY BOOT remains the canonical deterministic
  envelope template for constructing the next BOOT;
- every candidate is separately verified against the proven MAINLINE parent so
  ramdisk, post-ramdisk tail, geometry and AVB lineage cannot drift.

This distinction is packaging mechanics only. It does not demote the mainline
checkpoint or make Android the routine rollback target.
